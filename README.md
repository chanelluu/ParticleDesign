# Particle Design
A Design Framework for Handheld Augmented Reality.

Augmented Reality (AR) applications built for handheld devices have the potential to achieve widespread adoption, thanks to the abundance of smartphones and their hardware capabilities. The term Handheld Augmented Reality is used to describe AR experience that you can hold in your hands versus view through a headset, which is known as Head-worn Augmented Reality. However, designers and developers currently donâ€™t have a shared language system and guidelines that they can follow to aid the collaborative design process. 

Introducing Particle Design, a design framework for Handheld Augmented Reality (AR). 

It aims to onboard designers to the design concept in Handheld Augmented Reality within minutes. Particle Design, custom made for the medium, is equipped with a set of easy-to-understand terminology and interactive examples in the mobile app.
